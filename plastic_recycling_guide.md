## 1. Preparing the recycling material
Before starting the recycling process, thorough preparation of the plastic waste is crucial for successful results.

### 1.1 Material selection
Not all plastics are suitable for recycling with the Arteme 3D MK3. Use only:
- **PLA waste** (failed prints, support structures, old prints)
- **PETG scraps** (if available)
- **ABS material** (for experienced users only)

> **Important:** Never mix different plastic types! This can lead to clogs and poor quality results.

### 1.2 Material cleaning
1. Remove all contaminants like dust, hair, or foreign objects
2. Wash the material with warm water and mild detergent if needed
3. Let it dry completely (at least 24 hours)

### 1.3 Shredding the material
The material must be shredded into small, uniform pieces:

1. Use a **plastic shredder** or **scissors** for small quantities
2. Target size: **2-5 mm** particles
3. Avoid pieces that are too large and could clog the extruder

### 1.4 Sieving the shredded material
**Sieving is essential** for successful recycling:

1. Use a **fine mesh sieve** (2-3 mm openings) to separate particles
2. Remove all pieces that are too large or oddly shaped
3. Discard any dust or particles smaller than 1 mm (these can cause feeding problems)

> **Important:** Never skip the sieving step! Unsieved material is the most common cause of extruder jams and poor filament quality.

> **Tip:** Uniformly shredded and sieved particles lead to better melting quality and fewer clogs.

## 2. Extruder settings for recycled material

### 2.1 Temperature adjustment
Recycled material often requires higher temperatures than fresh pellets:

- **PLA recycled:** 190-200Â°C (vs. 180Â°C for fresh material)
- **PETG recycled:** 240-250Â°C
- **ABS recycled:** 250-260Â°C

### 2.2 Reduce extruder speed
Set the **Extruder RPM** 10-20% lower than with fresh material:

> **Reason:** Recycled material can have inconsistent melting properties and needs more time for homogeneous mixing.

### 2.3 Special settings
- **Fan speed:** Reduce by 20-30% for better melting quality
- **Pulling speed:** Pull slower for more stable diameter

## 3. The recycling process

### 3.1 Material change with recycled plastic
Since recycled material often contains contaminants, thorough cleaning is especially important:

1. Let the extruder run **15-30 minutes longer** than with fresh material
2. Observe the extruded filament for color changes
3. Only when the filament exits uniformly in the desired color is the change complete

### 3.2 Monitoring the extrusion
Recycled material requires more intensive monitoring:

**Watch for:**
- Uneven filament surface
- Air bubbles or inclusions
- Color streaks or spots
- Diameter fluctuations

### 3.3 Troubleshooting
When problems occur with recycled material:

**Clogs:**
1. Increase temperature by 5-10Â°C
2. Reduce extruder speed
3. Check for foreign objects in the material

**Air bubbles:**
1. Extend heating time
2. Reduce extruder speed
3. Ensure the material is completely dry

## 4. Quality control for recycled filament

### 4.1 Diameter measurement
Recycled filament often shows larger diameter variations:

- **Acceptable range:** 1.65-1.85 mm (vs. 1.73-1.77 mm for fresh material)
- Measure more frequently: every 30 cm instead of every 2 meters

### 4.2 Visual inspection
Check the filament for:
- Uniform surface
- Consistent color
- No visible contaminants
- No air bubbles or voids

### 4.3 Strength testing
Test the strength of the recycled filament:
1. Carefully bend a 10 cm long sample
2. The filament should not break immediately
3. If material is too brittle: increase temperature or reprocess material

## 5. Special tips for successful recycling

### 5.1 Material blending
For better properties, you can mix recycled material with fresh:

- **70% recycled + 30% fresh** = good balance between sustainability and quality
- **50% recycled + 50% fresh** = nearly identical properties to fresh material

### 5.2 Coloring recycled material
Masterbatches also work with recycled material:

- Use **5-7%** masterbatch (vs. 3% for fresh material)
- Dark colors cover contaminants better
- Light colors show quality problems more clearly

### 5.3 Storage of recycled filament
Recycled filament is more susceptible to moisture:

1. Store in **airtight containers** with silica gel
2. Use within **6 months**
3. If problems occur: dry filament at 40Â°C for 4-6 hours

## 6. Sustainability and environmental aspects

### 6.1 Recycling cycles
PLA can typically be recycled **3-5 times** before properties significantly decline:

- **1st cycle:** Minimal quality loss
- **2nd-3rd cycle:** Slight strength reduction
- **4th-5th cycle:** Only for less demanding applications

### 6.2 Energy balance
Recycling with the Arteme 3D MK3 is significantly more energy-efficient than new production:

- **70% less energy** than new production
- **Reduction of COâ‚‚ footprint** by about 60%

### 6.3 Waste reduction
Through consistent recycling you can:
- Reuse failed prints and support structures
- Process old or no longer needed prints into new filament
- Reduce the need for new filament by up to 40%

## 7. Troubleshooting and common problems

### 7.1 Poor adhesion when printing
Recycled filament can have worse printing properties:

**Solutions:**
- Increase bed temperature by 5-10Â°C
- Reduce print speed by 10-20%
- Set first layer thicker

### 7.2 Brittle or weak filament
When recycled filament is too weak:

1. Reduce recycling cycles
2. Mix with fresh material
3. Check drying quality

### 7.3 Extruder clogs
Recycled material can cause clogs more frequently:

**Prevention:**
- More thorough material cleaning
- Slower extrusion
- Regular extruder cleaning
